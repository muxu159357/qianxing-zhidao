# Find Skills

This skill helps you discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks "how do I do X" where X might be a common task with an existing skill
- Says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Asks "can you do X" where X is a specialized capability
- Expresses interest in extending agent capabilities
- Wants to search for tools, templates, or workflows

## What is the Skills CLI?

The Skills CLI (`npx skills`) is the package manager for the open agent skills ecosystem. Skills are modular packages that extend agent capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

**Key commands:**
- `npx skills find [query]` - Search for skills interactively or by keyword
- `npx skills add <package>` - Install a skill from GitHub or other sources
- `npx skills check` - Check for skill updates
- `npx skills update` - Update all installed skills

**Browse skills at:** https://skills.sh/

## How to Help Users Find Skills

### Step 1: Understand What They Need
Identify: the domain, the specific task, whether this is a common enough task that a skill likely exists.

### Step 2: Check the Leaderboard First
Check https://skills.sh/ leaderboard for top skills (ranked by total installs).

### Step 3: Search for Skills
```bash
npx skills find [query]
```

### Step 4: Verify Quality Before Recommending
1. **Install count** — Prefer skills with 1K+ installs. Be cautious with anything under 100.
2. **Source reputation** — Official sources (vercel-labs, anthropics, microsoft) are more trustworthy than unknown authors.
3. **GitHub stars** — Check the source repository. <100 stars → skepticism.

### Step 5: Present Options
Present with: skill name + what it does, install count + source, install command, link to learn more.

### Step 6: Offer to Install
```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y
```
